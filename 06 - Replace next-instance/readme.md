# 06 - Replace Next Instance of Word

This is similar to selecting multiple instances of a phrase in VSCode using `ctrl+d`.
Here are the steps and explanations:

1. Search for a phrase by typing `/phrase-to-search` while in `Normal` mode.
2. While in this mode we can go to the next search result by pressing `n`. Or go to previous result by pressing `N`.
3. To change the next instance of the search result we can type `cgn`.
4. We can let Vim repeat this action by pressing `.`
   We can also skip instances by press `n` to skip over an occurrence.
