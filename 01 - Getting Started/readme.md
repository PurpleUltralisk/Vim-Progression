# 01 - Getting Started
There are 2 modes in Vim: 
1. Insert mode - where you can edit your document 
2. Navigation mode - where you can move around in your document

## Navigation 
| Key | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| 'h' | move cursor left |
| 'j' | move cursor down |
| 'k' | move cursor up |
| 'l' | move cursor right |
| `:w` | to save file changes |
| `:q` | to exit file | 
| `:wq` | to save and quit | 

## Insert 
| Key | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| 'esc' | to quit `insert` mode |
| 'i' | to enter `insert` mode behind cursor |
| 'I' | to enter `insert` mode at end of line |
| 'a' | to enter `insert` mode in front of cursor |
| 'A' | to enter `insert` mode at beginning of line |

And that's all you need to get started in Vim.
